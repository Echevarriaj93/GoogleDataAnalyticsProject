No data on gender for a study specifically for women's products. Some women may be held back by biological factors such as menstrual cycles and pregnancy as compared to men's phusical output.\n\n##2.No data on age. Age is known to affect maximum heart rate capable for a human being.\n\n##3. Data is from 2016 so it may be outdated.

More intense activity leads to more calories burned in less time.\n\n##3.There seems to be a dual-relationship between being sedentary and active when it comes to sleep. Sedentary users sleep more likely due to being used to a sedentary life-style. Users who are moderately active sleep a healthy amount but less than those that are sedentary. Active users also see higher durations of sleep likely due to needing recovery.\n\n##4.  Heavier individuals are less active. Individuals between 150-200 pounds are the most active.\n\n**Stage 4 - Act**\n\nRecommendations\n\n##1.  The watch should have a feature that sets a daily goal for users to meet as well as recommendations of specific goals to meet based on their current physical shape and life style.\n\n##2.  The watch should have sleep recommendations such as a nudge based on user patterns as to when to go to sleep.\n\n##3.  The watch should also recommend types of excercises based on goals. We saw that high intensity resulted in more calories burned in less time. Perhaps incroporating features for High Intensity excercises could be useful for busier individuals.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
